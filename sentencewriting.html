<h1>Story One: </h1>
<img src="pictureone.jpg">
<p> One day, after school, there were two young boys, Sean, and Connor, who were walking home. As they were walking home, they saw a pumpkin field with three carved pumpkins.
 'I wonder which pumpkin I should get', said Connor. 'I dont know. They are all amazing!' said Sean. Soon, they each got one pumpkin, so they can carve their own pumpkins.</p>

Then, as they bend over, they smell something from the ground and started munching on something green. It tasted good. Hopefully, it will be taller tomorrow, so they can eat some more of it.

<p>
One winter day, a group of snow crew people were doing a mission for their Snow Patrol Club down in Wallatown. Their mission of the day was to climb
the Wallatown mountain, which is very streneuous and very tough. Also if they are not careful, it could be harmful. They made sure they had plenty of supplies with them,
including extra clothing, so that way, they could survive.  </p>
